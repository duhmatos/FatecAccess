#  This project is a system prototype developed during the second semester of the FATEC (Faculdade de Tecnologia) Analysis and Systems Development (ACES) course. It served as an Interdisciplinary Project (PI) aimed at applying core academic concepts to solve a real-world problem on campus.

Problem Statement: Campus Access Control Gap
The project addressed a critical issue on campus: the lack of physical access control (turnstiles/catracas). This absence compromises security and hampers accurate data collection, specifically related to:

Security Risk: Difficulty in verifying the identity of individuals entering the campus, exposing students and staff to potential unauthorized access.

Administrative Inefficiency: Inability to generate reliable, real-time attendance and traffic data for better resource management (e.g., managing facilities, class occupancy, and administrative compliance).

Project Integration (Disciplines in Practice)
The system's development demonstrated the direct application of knowledge acquired from three core disciplines:

Software Engineering I:

Focus: Structured the project using a defined Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) approach.

Deliverable: Defined functional and non-functional requirements and created system architecture documentation.

Informational Systems (Sistemas Informacionais):

Focus: Modeled the data flow and information strategy required for the system.

Deliverable: Designed the database structure to manage student records, access logs, and generate key reports for administrative decision-making.

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):

Focus: Ensured the system's interface was intuitive, secure, and accessible for both end-users (students/staff) and administrators.

Deliverable: Designed wireframes and prototypes focused on user experience (UX) for quick registration, access validation, and monitoring dashboards.
